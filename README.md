3rd semester

This repository has 3 main directorys. 
PLSQL, TSQL are directories for practices in those query languages.
Project directory has my semester projects in TSQL and PLSQL with initialisation of those databases and with some procedures and triggers attached.
I also included a database scheme image into project directory.
